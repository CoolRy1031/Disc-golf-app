This is the opening page of the app.  You will be asked to sign in via a google account.

After you have successfully logged in you can start by clicking the "Enter Course" link located in the top left of the nav bar. Once clicked you can enter the course that you are playing on.  It gives you the option to enter the course name, the par for the course you are playing and whether or not you are playing 9 or 18 holes.

This will take you to a view all page.  This has information on the users that have played certain courses'.  Once you find the course that you entered(this will populate in the order it has entered, so you will show up at the bottom) you can click the details page.  If you entered the incorrect course name or you changed your mind on the amount of holes you want to play you can click the edit page.  This will bring you to a view similar to the enter course page, where you can update that information.
