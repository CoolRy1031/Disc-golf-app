This is the opening page of the app.  You will be asked to sign in via a google account.

After you have successfully logged in you can start by clicking the "Enter Course" link located in the top left of the nav bar. Once clicked you can enter the course that you are playing on.  It gives you the option to enter the course name, the par for the course you are playing and whether or not you are playing 9 or 18 holes.

This will take you to a view all page.  This has information on the users that have played certain courses'.  Once you find the course that you entered(this will populate in the order it has entered, so you will show up at the bottom) you can click the details page.  If you entered the incorrect course name or you changed your mind on the amount of holes you want to play you can click the edit page.  This will bring you to a view similar to the enter course page, where you can update that information.

By clicking the details page you can keep track of your final score each time you play that specific course.  You can even write a review for fellow users to read.

Finally, if you click on the player's tab on the top of the nav bar it will populate with all of the users' that have used this app.  If you click on other user's it will show the courses' they have played on and their scores they have posted.  If you click on yourself the view will be the same but will give you the option to delete your individual scores that you posted on the details page.


Enhancements for the future
1. I would like for users to be able to keep track of their scores as they play each hole.  This will have to have additional routing to another page where users can enter scores as they play.
2. I would like to add locations for the course's. Which state and city they are in so other user's can find the course's that have been reviewed well or are generally interested in.
3. I would like to add additional information on the course such as hole details.  Distance of each hole and difficulty of the course.
4. As more users play this app, I would like to commit a seperate page for users to just be able to fetch the course's they play on.
